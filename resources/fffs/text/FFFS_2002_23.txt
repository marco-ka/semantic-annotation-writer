The information should also state how the customer shall submit a complaint against the institution. Similar information should also be available at every institution’s office and on their website. The customer should also be informed regarding the guidance which may be obtained from the Swedish Consumers’ Banking & Finance Bureau and the Swedish Consumers Insurance Bureau as well as through municipal consumers’ advice officials.

When a complaint cannot be resolved, the complainant should receive written information regarding the possibility to pursue the matter further within the institution. The customer should also be informed of the reasons for the rejection of the complaint by the institution. Such information should be provided in writing upon request by the customer.

Complaints should be handled efficiently and attentively. The institute should answer complaints objectively and correctly and in writing upon request by the customer.

Complaints should be answered as quickly as possible.
