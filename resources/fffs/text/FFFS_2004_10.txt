The auditor should not provide consultancy services at the institution or at a company closely related to it without Finansinspektionen's consent. This also applies to persons subordinate to the auditor.

The auditor should pay particular attention to the institution's internal control systems in his audit. The auditor should also pay particular attention to the management of the existing risks in the business activities and how guidelines and instructions are applied.

The auditor in a life insurance company should pay particular attention to transactions taking place between the life insurance company and other companies in the same group and the supporting documents for decisions on those transactions. The auditor should also compare these with the life insurance company's own guidelines.

If any change of auditor occurs during the current financial year, Finansinspektionen should be informed immediately.
