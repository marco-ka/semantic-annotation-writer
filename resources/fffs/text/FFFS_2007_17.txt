If the distribution or value requirements set out in section 2, second paragraph do not exist, official listing may occur provided that the securities exchange determines that the market conditions are still satisfactory.

Official listing may also occur if the documents referred to in section 2, first paragraph, subsection c can be produced for fewer than three financial years if the investors are judged to have access to the requisite information to be able to make an informed assessment of the issuer and the transferable securities that are the subject of the official listing application.

Section 2, second paragraph, subsections a and d do not apply to the official listing of additional blocks of shares of the same class as those already registered.

Where applicable, official listing of transferable securities in a foreign firm shall be subject to that which is prescribed for transferable securities in a Swedish firm.

Shares in a foreign CIU may be registered on a securities exchange if the foreign CIU conducts fund activities in its home Member State and is under the supervision of an authority or other authorised body.
