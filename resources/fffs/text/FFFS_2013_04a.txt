Provisions regarding which portion of a mortgage loan may be included in the cover pool are set out in Chapter 3, section 3 of the Covered Bonds (Issuance) Act (2003:1223). An issuing institution shall establish the primary intended purpose of the mortgage property when applying the regulation.

The issuing institution, when determining the primary intended purpose of the mortgage property, should obtain guidance from the land register's type codes for taxation information. If the type codes are not updated or for other reasons do not accurately depict the property's area of use, the institution may establish more correct grounds for its assessment in collaboration with Finansinspektionen.

Where a property covers several assessment units, the institution may determine the primary use with the assistance of sub-values in the tax assessment value.

The institution should also apply these general guidelines to foreign mortgage properties. In these cases the assessment should be documented.

Provisions stating that an issuing institution shall verify on a regular basis the market value of property that forms collateral for mortgage loans are set out in Chapter 3, section 7 of the Covered Bonds (Issuance) Act (2003:1223).
