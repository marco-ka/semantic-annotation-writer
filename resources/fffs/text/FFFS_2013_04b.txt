If the price levels of comparable properties fall, the institution shall verify that the property that forms collateral for mortgage loans has the same value as in the original or most recent valuation. Where the market conditions for comparable properties at the locality or in the region have seriously declined, the valuation shall be re-assessed.

The institution shall verify in particular the prices in the regions or within the categories where the fall in prices, or the risk that prices will fall, is the largest.
