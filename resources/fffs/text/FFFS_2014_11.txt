In its credit assessment, a lender should assess the financial circumstances of a consumer based on his or her income, assets, expenditure and debts, as well as any guarantee undertaking. The credit assessment should be based on written material or other reliable information, such as a credit report.

A credit assessment should be performed even if collateral is provided for the loan.

The lender should notify the consumer clearly of the reason why he or she has not been granted a loan by stating the grounds for the decision. Where the grounds for the decision are the result of a “credit calculation model”, the lender should provide a more detailed explanation if so requested by the consumer.
