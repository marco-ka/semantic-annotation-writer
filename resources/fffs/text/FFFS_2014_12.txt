An undertaking and all or some of its subsidiary undertakings may waive application of Article 412 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms given the conditions referred to in Article 8(2) of the Regulation.

A waiver requires the undertaking to submit written notification to Finansinspektionen stating which undertakings are included in the liquidity sub-group. In its notification, the undertaking shall also certify that (1) the conditions in Articles 8(1)(a)–8(1)(d) of the Regulation are fulfilled, and (2) legal opinions exist stating that the conditions in Articles 8(1)(c) and 8(1)(d) of the Regulation are fulfilled.

The legal opinion pursuant to section 1 shall be issued by an external, independent legal advisor with extensive experience in the field. The opinion shall be addressed directly to the institution.

An investment firm which does not have authorisation pursuant to Chapter 2, section 1, point 3 of the Securities Market Act (2007:528) does not need to apply Articles 411–428 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms. This also applies to a group of investment firms where none of the undertakings in the group have authorisation pursuant to Chapter 2, section 1, point 3 of the Securities Market Act.
