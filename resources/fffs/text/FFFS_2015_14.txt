In order to identify, measure, govern, report internally and control the risks associated with its operations, an undertaking should have a remuneration policy that is consistent with and promotes an effective risk management and does not encourage excessive risk-taking. The remuneration policy should encompass all employees.

The remuneration policy should be subject to regular reviews to ensure that it develops in line with changes to the undertakingâ€™s situation. The undertaking should base a decision about the design of the remuneration policy on an analysis of how the policy affects the risks the undertaking is exposed to and how these risks are managed.
