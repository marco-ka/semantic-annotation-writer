An insurance undertaking may, with the consent of Finansinspektionen, obtain an exemption under section 1 if the undertaking (1) is able to demonstrate that it will discontinue its operations before 1 January 2019, or (2) is in liquidation and a liquidator has been appointed.

If the undertaking is part of a group, in accordance with Chapter 19 of the Insurance Business Act (2010:2043), all insurance providers in the group shall have ceased issuing new insurance contracts in order to discontinue their operations before the exemption can be granted.

The insurance undertaking shall also (1) inform Finansinspektionen that it is applying the exemption, and (2) submit an annual report to Finansinspektionen on the progress it has made towards discontinuing its operations.
