An undertaking shall update its recovery plan or group recovery plan on an annual basis or in conjunction with changes to its business that could have a material impact on the recovery plan or the group recovery plan.

A recovery plan or a group recovery plan may not assume the provision of public financial support.

A recovery plan and a group recovery plan, where applicable, shall include an analysis of how and when the undertaking that prepared the plan, under the conditions addressed by the plan, may apply for the use of central bank facilities. In this analysis, the undertaking shall identify those assets which would be expected to qualify as collateral by central banks concerned.
