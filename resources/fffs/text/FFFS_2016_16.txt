When granting a new loan, an undertaking may only grant or extend a loan if the borrower undertakes to amortise the loan as a minimum in accordance with these regulations.

In its calculation of the loan-to-value ratio, an undertaking shall use the market value that applied when the residential property was acquired. The undertaking may instead use the market value determined during a later revaluation for the calculation of the loan-to-value ratio.

A revaluation according to the first paragraph may be performed at the earliest five years after the residential property was acquired or following the last revaluation that resulted in a change in the amortisation amount. However, a revaluation may be performed earlier than this if there has been a material change in the residential propertyâ€™s market value for reasons other than the general development on the market for residential properties.
