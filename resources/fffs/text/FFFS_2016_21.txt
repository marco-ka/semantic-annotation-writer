The undertaking should have a remuneration policy to identify, measure, govern, report internally and control the risks associated with its business. The remuneration policy should be in line with and promote effective risk management and not encourage excessive risk-taking. The remuneration policy should encompass all employees.

When the undertaking uses variable remuneration, it should take into consideration how such may affect earnings in the long run. When the undertaking decides the basis for remuneration, it should be attentive to the fact that performance can be affected retrospectively by current and future risks. In its performance measurement, the undertaking should take account of the actual costs for maintaining capital and liquidity that are inherent to the operations being measured.

The undertaking should base performance-based remuneration on the employeeâ€™s performance as well as the performance of the relevant business unit and the undertaking as a whole. When the firm determines the remuneration for an employee, it should take into account qualitative criteria, such as that the employee complies with internal rules and procedures and respects the rules concerning conduct toward customers and investors.
