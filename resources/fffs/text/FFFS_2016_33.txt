When a firm grants a loan collateralised by a home the loan should be limited such that the loan-to-value ratio for the home does not exceed 85 per cent of the home's market value at the time the loan is granted.

This limitation to the loan-to-value ratio should be established in the firm's credit instructions, where applicable.
