variable remuneration. Exceptions to this ratio shall be approved on a case-by-case
basis by the governing body.

Section 20 An AIF manager's performance assessment used to calculate variable
remuneration components shall primarily be based on risk-adjusted profit
measures. Both current and future risks shall be taken into account.

If an AIF manager adjusts its performance for risk based on subjective
assessments, the considerations that serve as the basis for the adjustment shall be
well balanced and documented.

Section 21 An AIF manager's performance assessment shall be based on a multi-
year perspective that has been adapted to the life cycle of the alternative investment
funds under management. This shall safeguard in part that the assessment is based
on sustainable long-term performance and in part that the redemption policy and
investment risks of the managed alternative investment funds are taken into
consideration when paying variable remuneration.

Section 22 An AIF manager shall base the variable remuneration to identified
staff on the employee's performance, on the affected business unit's or the
alternative investment fund's performance and on the manager's total performance.

assessment of the employee's performance.

The financial and non-financial criteria used by the AIF manager as a basis for
remuneration decisions shall be specified and documented.

Information for identified staff

remuneration to identified staff whose variable remuneration over a period of one
year totals at least SEK 100,000 is deferred for a period of not less than three to
five years before it is paid or the right of ownership is transferred to the employee.
When the manager decides what portion of the variable remuneration will be
deferred, and for how long, it shall take into account the life cycle, redemption
policy and investment risks in the alternative investment fund to which the
remuneration is attributable as well as the employee's responsibility and work
